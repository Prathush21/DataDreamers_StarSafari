# Get started with our Project


1. __Clone the Git Repository__ 
Begin by cloning our Git repository to your local machine. You can do this using the following command in your terminal:<br>
`git clone <repository_url>)`<br>
Replace <__repository_url__> with the actual URL of our Git repository.

2. __Navigate to the Project Folder__
Change your working directory to the project folder:<br>
`cd <project_folder>`<br>
Replace <__project_folder__> with the name of the folder where the repository was cloned.

3. __Install Dependencies__
Next, you'll need to install project dependencies using npm (Node Package Manager). Run the following command:<br>
`npm install`<br>
This command will download and install all the necessary packages and libraries required for the project.

4. __Set Up Android Emulator__
Before running the project on an Android emulator, make sure you have the Android emulator installed and configured. If you haven't set up an emulator yet, follow the Android documentation to create and configure one: [Android Emulator Setup](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/managing-avds)

5. __Start the Android Emulator__
Start your Android emulator. You can do this either via Android Studio or by using the command line tools.

6. __Run the Project__
Finally, to launch the project on the Android emulator, run the following command:<br>
`npm run android`<br>
This command will build and deploy the app to your Android emulator.
